Instructions to Run Code
Change
initial_puzzle 
and 
puzzle_goal
to the same initial puzzle number and goal number
(initial_puzzle1,puzzle_goal1) | (initial_puzzle2,puzzle_goal2) |(initial_puzzle3,puzzle_goal3) |(initial_puzzle4,puzzle_goal4) |(initial_puzzle5,puzzle_goal5) 
  
ex. for puzzle 3        
initial_puzzle = initial_puzzle3 # Set Which Puzzle I want to solve
goal = puzzle_goal3              # Set Which goal I want to solve

Then choose the type of heuristic with the type of algorithm
# Choose the Heuristic and the algorithm to solve
heuristic = "Manhattan" # Misplaced | Manhattan | Both 
algorithm = "A_Star" # Greedy | A_Star


*Puzzle 4 and 5 are the hard puzzles and this doesn't find the solutions on some combinations (*in an hour)
